<center><p>My favorite women in technology is Sheryl Sandberg, the COO of Facebook. This may seem like an obvious choice, but she is most of the most powerful voices fighting to close the gender gap in technology. She's not afraid to acknowledge how small the number of women in leadership positions is, and she doesn't hesitate to try and change it.     <p>
<center><p>I joined GWC because I remember watching movies and seeing people type all this random stuff on there computers which had a beneficial output, and I honestly thought it was so cool. I wanted to be able to do the same thing, so I joined GWC to get a basic foundation for the concepts of coding. <p>
<center><p>Other girl should join GWC because it's a skill you can use in any job. Girls who join can see that working with computers isn't something only men can do. They will meet new people who share there same interest and learn important skills that will last forever. <p>
<center><p>I love to be active and enjoy running on our school's running teams. I also enjoy art, specifically drawing. A fun fact about me is that im a vegetarian.<p>
